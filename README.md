# IntellCreatio

Architecture for Discord bot, for convenient operation.

To configure the bot, you must refer to two files in this project, that is `config.ts` and `.env.example`.

**.env.example** - rename file to `.env` and configure the file.

**config.ts** - This file is needed to fully configure the bot, you can also add those fields you want but be careful with those fields that already exist.
